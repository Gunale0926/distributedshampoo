    """Reshapes tensor by merging small dimensions.

    This function merges adjacent dimensions of a tensor when their product is below
    the specified threshold, which helps optimize operations on tensors with many
    small dimensions.

    Note:
    - Shampoo will promote 0D tensor (torch.Size([]) into an 1D tensor (torch.Size([1])).
    - Empty tensors (with a dimension of size 0) will return a shape of (0,).
    - Dimensions of size 1 are removed (squeezed) before merging.
    - If all dimensions are 1, it returns (1,).
    - Dimensions are merged in reverse order to accommodate PyTorch's tensor layout.

    Args:
        tensor_shape (tuple[int, ...]): The shape of the tensor.
        threshold (int): Threshold on the maximum size of each dimension.
        target_tensor_dimensionality (int | float): Target dimensionality of the tensor. Only merge until the target dimensionality is reached.
            If target_tensor_dimensionality > len(tensor_shape), then no merging occurs. The only float that can be used is math.inf.
            Note that the output tensor will NOT necessarily have dimension equal to target_tensor_dimensionality.
            The merging will stop before reaching target_tensor_dimensionality if the threshold is small.

    Returns:
        new_tensor_shape (tuple[int, ...]): New tensor shape after merging dimensions.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If target_tensor_dimensionality is a float but not math.inf.

    Example:
        - merge_small_dims((1, 2, 5, 1), threshold=10, target_tensor_dimensionality=1) -> (10,)
          All dimensions are merged as their product (10) is equal to the threshold.

        - merge_small_dims((1, 2, 5, 1), threshold=1, target_tensor_dimensionality=1) -> (2, 5)
          Dimensions of size 1 are removed, and no merging occurs as 2*5 > threshold.

        - merge_small_dims((32, 3, 64, 64), threshold=8192, target_tensor_dimensionality=1) -> (96, 4096)
          For convolution-like dimensions, merges into (32*3, 64*64) as 96 < threshold
          but 96*4096 > threshold.

        - merge_small_dims((32, 3, 64, 64), threshold=1_000_000, target_tensor_dimensionality=2) -> (32, 12_288)
          For convolution-like dimensions, merges into (32, 3*64*64) despite 32*3*64*64 < threshold because
          target_tensor_dimensionality is 2. This is useful for spectral descent methods like Muon.
